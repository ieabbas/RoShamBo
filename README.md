# RoShamBo
A "Rock-Paper-Scissor" game where the computer doesn't lose.

This simple program will utilize the frequency counting algorithm to play RPS such that the computer
will never lose in a 10 game series.

* While metastrategy algorithms have proven to be the most effective, more algorithms will be implemente at a later date.
* MetaStrategy: Frequency Counting -> Rotation -> Random Choice
